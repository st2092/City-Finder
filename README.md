# City-Finder (v1.0)
Android App practice with GoogleMap API

__Description__

This application reads in a list of cities then puts a marker on the map for each city. In addition, the application attempts to get the user's location if location service is enable on the device. If obtaining the user's location is successful, clicking on a marker will add a drawn line from the user's location to the marker (destination).
